            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="text-secondary mb-6">
           Hi, I'm Jason Toft, a second-year biomedical engineering student. My journey into biomedical engineering began with 
           a fascination for how the human body works and a desire to make a long-lasting impact on peopleâ€™s lives through science and design. 
           I've always been drawn to math and biology, and biomedical engineering seemed like the perfect blend of both worlds: 
           applying engineering concepts to solve problems in healthcare.
          </p>
          <p className="text-secondary mb-6">
            At the University of Waterloo, I've had the opportunity to learn through co-op, 
            design teams, and undergraduate research assistantships. It makes my time here busy, 
            but I'm loving every second of it!
          </p>
          <p className="text-secondary">
           Outside of school and internships, you'll find me playing beach volleyball, 
           learning a new instrument, or reading a book. I'm also currently on exchange in Madrid,
           learning Spanish! Feel free to connect with me through the links below!
          </p>
